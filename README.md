# Cryptography and Network Security: History, Theory, and Application
**by Walter Pach and supervised by Dr. Chin-Tser Huang at the UofSC**

This study analyzes the way that cryptography has historically developed, is
implemented today, and may be implemented in the future. Topics covered 
include protocols, methodology, and infrastructure for cryptographic systems.

The aims include: an understanding of ciphers, cryptographic hashing, 
public-key cryptosystems, and basic mathematic principles underlying encryption.
Following a basic understanding, the focus will cover the application of 
cryptography in secure network communication for confidentiality and privacy.
