# Reading Notes for _NIST: Cryptography_
The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the official
U.S. Government guidance and requirements for cryptographic technology. Working
closely with the National Security Agency, they develop, test, and publish
cryptographic recommendations, tools, and standards.

The Data Encryption Standards (DES) was published in 1977, but is much too weak
for contemporary application. Instead, NIST has implemented new recommendations
including the AES. 

NIST provides standardization and testing of cryptographic algorithms, as well
as their use. Some of the key projects right now include:
    - Post-quantum cryptography
    - Hashing algorithms
    - Random bit generation
    - Lightweight cryptography.

Additionally, NIST publishes a document called FIPS-140, titled "Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules." This document specifies the federal
minimums and standards for cryptographic hardware and software units.
